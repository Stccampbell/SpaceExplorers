# SpaceExplorers
Technology explaination:
So in this game I made a resource object and two random event objects. There are two phases that the game cycles through a main phase and a travel phase. At the end of each phase the resources the player has are updated and the random event changes. I do this mostly through for loops callback functions and interoplation.


Approach Taken:
The way i approached the making of this game was by building the dom manipulation for each turn first that way I could see my changes as I make them. Then I made the resource object. Then I made the standard resource changes. Then I made the random events. I ended on Style and Endscreen.

User stories:
As a user I want to be able to see different art for each kind of random event.

As a user I want the text of the options to be unique for each game option and event.

As a user I want to be able to clearly see how my choices effect the game.

How to use:
The game is simple. Read the dialoge boxes which will tell you either to increase your resources speed ahead or explore your random encounter. Every turn you will be given these options. If you make it to the new Planet you win. If all your colonists die before the end you lose.

Unsolved Problems:
No end game animation.
Colonist related random encounters are having issues.
